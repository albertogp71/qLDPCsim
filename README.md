# qLDPCsim
---
qLDPCsim is a toolkit for performance evaluation of quantum LDPC error correction codes focused on decoding algorithms.
Simulation of noise channels and generation of symdrome measurements is done using [stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim).

qLDPCsim has the foollowing modules:
- **PCMlibrary**: a library of parity check matrix pairs (Hx, Hz).
- **decoders**: qLDPC decoders.
- **simulate**: simulation execution.

qLDPC is at an initial development stage -- more features will be added.
