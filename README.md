# qLDPCsim
---
qLDPCsim is a toolkit for simulation of quantum LDPC error correction codes focused on decoding algorithms.
It uses [stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) for simulation of noise channels and generation of symdrome measurements.
qLDPCsim has the foollowing modules:
- **PCMlibrary**: A library of parity check matrix pairs (Hx, Hz).
- **decoders**: qLDPC decoders.
- **eval**: performance evaluation functions.

qLDPC is in its initial development stage.
Some parts need testing.
